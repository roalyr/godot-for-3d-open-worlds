</p>

This flavor of Godot 3.x engine is made to accommodate large open-world 3D games.

This fork is regularly synchronized with [3.x branch](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/3.x).

Available for Windows x86-64, Linux x86-32 and x86-64, Linux ARM32 and ARM64, Android ARM32 and ARM64.

Implemented tweaks:
* Far plane (z-far) upper limit is set to 9e18 meters and tweaked for precision.
* Increased editor zoom out distance to galactic scale (depth buffer must be adjusted for such scales, see below).
* Increased editor zoom increment for faster zooming.
* This 3.x fork build DOES NOT implement hard-coded logarithmic depth buffer. You can implement it in your project shaders (see below).

Suggested:
Use [logarithmic depth](https://outerra.blogspot.com/search?q=logarithmic&max-results=20&by-date=true) in your spatial shaders to achieve rendering at extreme distances
without z-fighting. Keep in mind that this may break some depth-related effects and shadow-casting.


```
// Add this before your vertex shader.
// Edit "Fcoef" to adjust for desirable view distance. Lesser number means further distance limit.
uniform float Fcoef = 0.001;
varying float gl_Position_z;

// Add this to your vertex shader.
void vertex()
{
	vec4 gl_Position = MODELVIEW_MATRIX*vec4(VERTEX, 1.0);
	gl_Position_z = gl_Position.z;
}

//Add this to your fragment shader.
void fragment()
{
	DEPTH = log2(max(1e-6, 1.0 -gl_Position_z)) * Fcoef;
}


```

## Installation
Binaries available for Linux, Windows and Android.
You can download binaries and templates (debug) at [releases](https://github.com/roalyr/godot-for-3d-open-worlds/releases/).
You can build it from source. Refer to `rebuild_` scripts in root folder for convenience.

Reminder for cross-compiling for Windows:
```
To use posix mode for mingw by default:

$ sudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
<choose x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc-posix from the list>
$ sudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
<choose x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++-posix from the list>
```

## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools](https://godotengine.org/features), so that users can focus on making games
without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a
number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS,
Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms
(HTML5) and
[consoles](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/)
not-for-profit.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
Godot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project) for several
years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire titles.

## Getting the engine

### Binary downloads

Official binaries for the Godot editor and the export templates can be found
[on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/download).

### Compiling from source

[See the official docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/)
for compilation instructions for every supported platform.

## Community and contributing

Godot is not only an engine but an ever-growing community of users and engine
developers. The main community channels are listed [on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/community).

The best way to get in touch with the core engine developers is to join the
[Godot Contributors Chat](https://chat.godotengine.org).

To get started contributing to the project, see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Documentation and demos

The official documentation is hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.godotengine.org).
It is maintained by the Godot community in its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs).

The [class reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/)
is also accessible from the Godot editor.

We also maintain official demos in their own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects)
as well as a list of [awesome Godot community resources](https://github.com/godotengine/awesome-godot).

There are also a number of other
[learning resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/tutorials.html)
provided by the community, such as text and video tutorials, demos, etc.
Consult the [community channels](https://godotengine.org/community)
for more information.
